Given 
1) arrival rate per class
2) service rate per resource per class (distribution, load-dependent)
3) a network of queues 
4) mean visits to each center k (+ routing matrix)

compute 
1) resource utilization
2) throughput 
3) queue length & response time

model has to multiclass, open, multiserver 
maybe load-dependent

how to model rocksdb?

solve 
1) analytic : 
2) simulation : is usually more detailed 

Validate results with atleast 2 different tools

Component analysis - how do changes in resource capacity affect throughput and change bottlenecks?

Transient analysis
