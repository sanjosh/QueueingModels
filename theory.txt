Theory:

Little's law:

Bottlenecks cause traffic shaping.   When two queues operate in series, first queue shapes arrival rates on second

Closed form results are difficult for network of queues.  Hence, the need for separability criteria or product-form.  Or resort to iterative methods

Network is separable if it satisfies BCMP theorem.  MVA can be applied to such networks 

In a closed circuit, state of each queue is interdependent on all other ueues.  Hence no closed form analytic solution.  Techniques for separable closed circuits developed using convolution method.

Individual component times are random and can be drawn from an exponential distribution.  End-to-end-time is gamma distributed because it is cumulative of individual exp distributions.


Reiser Lavenberg : MVT : Customer arriving at queue in Product form network sees same average number in queue as an outside observer will see if network had one customer less. - this is basis of MVA algo

Due to feedback, service time becomes dilated but queue length is unaffected.
Jackson theorem: After first queue, inter-interval times are correlated with packet lengths.  If this correlation is eliminated, then each queue can be assumed to be M/M/1 

Kleinrock independence assumption : simplifies network of queues with unstable flow

Burke theorem for M/M/1, M/M/m or M/M/inf : reversible

Poisson arrivals see time averages
Pollaczek-Khintchine for M/G/1

Poisson with feedback is not Poisson


Jackson theorem for single server and Poisson arrival:
Jackson has extensions

Plot graph of Y=Response Time, X = Throughput
Power = Throughput/Response Time

Chandy-Herzog-Woo theorem is equiv of Norton's theorem in electrical circuits.


FESC - flow equiv service center - used for finite buffers

Time/function = instructions/func * cycles/instr * time/cycle

======

For product form networks, solutions can be determined analytically

For open, use forced flow
For closed, use iterative algo

For single class, MVA uses 3 equations
* Little's law global
* Little's law local
* Service center residence time

For multiple class,  same 3 equations as above

Approx MVA Algos
* Chow
* Bard-Schweitzer
* Linearizer
* De Souza-Muntz linearizer
* AQL (Aggregate Queue Length)

Moment Analysis

Questions:
* can an open finite buffer queue be converted to closed ?
